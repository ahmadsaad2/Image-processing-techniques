**Description:**

The Image Processing Techniques App is a versatile Python application designed to empower users with the ability to apply a diverse set of filters to images effortlessly. With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), users can load images and transform them using a variety of image processing filters. These filters cater to different image enhancement and analysis needs, allowing users to explore creative and practical applications.

**Filters:**

1. **Grayscale Conversion:**
   - Converts a color image to grayscale, simplifying the representation to intensity values.

2. **Point Detection:**
   - Enhances the image by emphasizing key points using a specific convolution kernel.

3. **Horizontal Line Detection:**
   - Identifies horizontal edges and lines within the image, revealing structural patterns.

4. **Vertical Line Detection:**
   - Similar to horizontal detection but focuses on vertical edges and lines.

5. **+45° Line Detection:**
   - Detects edges and lines oriented at a positive 45-degree angle.

6. **-45° Line Detection:**
   - Detects edges and lines oriented at a negative 45-degree angle.

7. **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG):**
   - Applies a convolution filter combining Gaussian blurring and Laplacian sharpening.

8. **Zero Crossing Detection:**
   - Identifies points where the intensity changes sign, useful for edge detection.

9. **User-Defined Filter:**
   - Allows users to create custom convolution filters by specifying size and coefficients.

10. **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    - Segments the image by dynamically adjusting the threshold based on local image characteristics.

11. **+45° Edge Detection:**
    - Detects edges oriented at a positive 45-degree angle.

12. **-45° Edge Detection:**
    - Detects edges oriented at a negative 45-degree angle.

13. **Horizontal Edge Detection:**
    - Identifies edges in the horizontal direction.

14. **Vertical Edge Detection:**
    - Identifies edges in the vertical direction.
15- Prewitt Horizontal Edge Detection:

16- The Prewitt Horizontal Edge Detection filter :
is a powerful tool designed to identify horizontal edges and structures within an image.

17- Prewitt Vertical Edge Detection:
The Prewitt Vertical Edge Detection filter is tailored for revealing vertical edges and structures within an image. Utilizing a convolution kernel that accentuates changes in intensity along the vertical direction.

18- Prewitt Diagonal -45° Edge Detection:
The Prewitt Diagonal -45° Edge Detection filter specializes in identifying edges and structures oriented at a negative 45-degree angle. By applying a specific convolution kernel.

19- Prewitt Diagonal +45° Edge Detection:
The Prewitt Diagonal +45° Edge Detection filter excels in detecting edges and structures oriented at a positive 45-degree angle. 

**Usage:**
- Open an image.
- Choose a filter from the available options.
- Adjust filter-specific parameters (if applicable).
- Observe the real-time preview of the filtered image.
- Save the transformed image for further use.

**Benefits:**
- Streamlined GUI for easy navigation.
- Interactive parameter input for certain filters.
- Versatility in image processing applications.
- Enables users to experiment with various filters for creative and analytical purposes.
